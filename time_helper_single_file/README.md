## Description

The Circular Countdown Timer is a minimalist, responsive, and easy-to-use web application designed to manage short, focused time intervals. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, the timer offers preset options (1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes) and features a clean, circular visual progress indicator that makes tracking time effortless at a glance.

The initial motivation for this project was twofold: 
* first, to provide a distraction-free tool for managing structured home workout intervals (using the timer for reps and rest periods); and 
* second, to precisely monitor in-game cooldowns, such as the strategic upgrade times in games like SimCity BuildIt.  

This dual-purpose focus on clear, immediate visual feedback ensures that users can stay productive and entertained without losing track of time.

Designed using modern web standards (HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS), the application is intentionally light-weight, scalable, and fully customizable. The highly responsive layout adapts flawlessly from mobile screens to large desktop monitors, providing a reliable experience across all devices.

## Dependencies
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
